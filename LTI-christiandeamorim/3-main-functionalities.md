# Main 3 Use Cases

Based on the core value propositions of **Structure**, **Bias Mitigation**, and **Agentic Automation**, here are the 3 main use cases that define the system's basic functionality:

## 1. Role Intake & Alignment (Structure)
**Why:** This addresses the "structural misalignment" bottleneck. It ensures that before any candidate is sourced, the recruiter and hiring manager are aligned on the role's priorities and evaluation criteria.
- **Key Features:** Collaborative definition of responsibilities, priorities, and "must-have" vs "nice-to-have" skills.

## 2. Anonymous Screening & Ranking (Bias Mitigation)
**Why:** This is a key competitive differentiator ("Bias Mitigation Framework"). It replaces subjective CV review with an objective, data-driven process.
- **Key Features:** Automated hiding of PII (names, photos) and ML-based ranking of candidates based on skills and potential.

## 3. Agentic Interview Management (Automation)
**Why:** This delivers the highest ROI in terms of time saved ("5-10 hours per week") and enforces the structured process.
- **Key Features:** AI "Twin" handles all scheduling logistics, while the system enforces the use of **Mandated Scorecards** during the actual interview to ensure objective data collection.
